== Purpose

The *Categorization of Chinese Standards* (CCS) codes are the PRC-equivalent
of the ISO ICS codes, used mainly in the library categorization of PRC standards.

These codes came from a Word Doc given to the Metanorma project from a contact
close to GB standards development.

The file is named `中国标准文献分类法（中标分类CCS）.doc`, available at
